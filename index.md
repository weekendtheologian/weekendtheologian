# Weekend Theologian

Theology doesn’t have to be confusing, combative, or exhausting.

Weekend Theologian exists to help everyday Christians see Scripture as one unified story of a God who keeps His promises—without pressure to pick sides, master systems, or win arguments.

This is a place for slow reading, careful thinking, and gracious faith.
