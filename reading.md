This page is a running journal of books I’m reading:

Started Vaughan Roberts "God's Big Picture Tracing the storyline of the Bible"

Ch.1 Takeaways
- The Bible is not a collection of religious ideas to sort out, but a single story to step into.

- Chapter 1 teaches that many people struggle with theology not because Scripture is unclear, but because they encounter it out of order—learning doctrines, debates, and positions before understanding the Bible’s overarching story. When that happens, theology feels fragmented, argumentative, and overwhelming.

- Roberts’ core insight for the beginner (and the weary): You don’t start by choosing a theological system. You start by listening to the Bible’s story.

- Chapter 1 reframes theology as orientation, not argument. It invites readers to slow down, zoom out, and recover confidence that Scripture makes sense when read as a unified narrative centered on God’s kingdom.

- Theology shouldn’t feel like picking sides in a fight you didn’t start
- Confusion often comes from starting in the middle of debates
- The Bible itself provides the framework—if we let it speak first

Chapter 1 reminds us that theology becomes clear not when we master systems, but when we learn to follow the Bible’s story from beginning to end.
