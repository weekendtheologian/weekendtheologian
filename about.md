# About

Weekend Theologian is written for people who love Scripture but feel overwhelmed by theological systems, debates, and labels.

This site is not here to win arguments.
It exists to offer orientation, clarity, and rest.

Faithful Christians have disagreed for centuries.
That doesn’t mean Scripture has failed.
