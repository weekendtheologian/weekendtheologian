# Comics

I love comics and graphic novels.

Not because they simplify stories—
but because they force clarity.

Every panel asks a question:
- What matters *now*?
- What can be shown instead of explained?
- What happens in the space between moments?

These questions shape how I think about Scripture.

The Bible is a story told in scenes, pauses, repetitions, echoes, and images.

Comics trained me to read the "bubbles" slowly. To look at the panel art. To see how they connect to the next set of "bubbles" and art.
To notice structure. How the artist can accelerate or slow down the story.
To respect silence. How moments can be decompressed.

That instinct carries directly into how I approach theology here:
less system first, more story first.

Thanks Spidey.
