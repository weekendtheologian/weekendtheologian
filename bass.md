# Bass

I play bass. Noob level. 

Not professionally. Not impressively. But faithfully.

Bass taught me to listen before speaking.
To support without being seen.
To hold rhythm so others can flourish above it.

In many ways, bass was a parallel to learning theology:

- You don’t notice the bass until it’s missing.
- You feel it more than you hear it.
- When it’s doing its job well, it makes everything else make sense.
- Arrogance leads to mistakes.

This site isn’t about music.
But music is part of how I learned to pay attention. And humility. Lots of humility
